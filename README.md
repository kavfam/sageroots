# This repo is based on a John Smilga Svelte app tutorial, with a few changes and works fine Sept 2022. The app here is run on Netlify while the backend Strapi runs on Heroku (for now, waiting to see if Salesforce continue with their Nov 28 planned move to kill all free/hobby plans). Images are hosted on Cloudinary.
